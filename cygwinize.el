;;; Commentary:

;; This module contains some extra compatability utilities that are
;; useful for interacting with Cygwin, and with Windows in general.

;;; Code:

(defun cygwinize-convert-file-name-to-hybrid-windows
    (file &optional absolute-p)
  "As `cygwin-convert-file-name-to-windows', with forward slashes."
  (replace-regexp-in-string "\\\\" "/"
                            (cygwin-convert-file-name-to-windows
                             file absolute-p)))

(defun cygwinize-hide-dos-eol ()
  "Do not show ^M in files containing mixed UNIX and DOS line endings."
  (interactive)
  (setq buffer-display-table (make-display-table))
  (aset buffer-display-table ?\^M []))
