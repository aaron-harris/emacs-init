PROPS is an alist associating property names (strings) to their
desired values (also strings, which will typically include
template escapes like '%^').

If PROPS is omitted, the property drawer will be
empty. Explicitly including an empty drawer can be useful in the
situation where TEMPLATE already includes a logbook drawer;
otherwise, when properties are added to the entry during capture,
the resulting property drawer may be indented differently than
the logbook drawer."
